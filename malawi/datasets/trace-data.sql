  TODO: Answer the below questions

  - Do we want to include patients who are late for EID?  We are.
  - Do we want to include patients who are still enrolled in HIV, but not in ART or EID (eg. Pre-ART)?
  - Similar to this, do we limit the trace criteria to ART, EID, and NCD patients (eg. not enrolled in HIV Program broadly).  We are.
  - Should we include the patient's HCC Number under EID Number, if they were Pre-ART but not EID?  We are not.
  - For visits and appointment dates, should we include visits outside of the enrollment location (eg. see 10016351)?  We are not.
  - For High BP Priority patients (> 180/110), should we limit this to patients who have a hypertension visit?  We are not, just looking at BP.
  - For Insulin Priority patients, should this be only patients on Insulin on Last Visit?  On Diabetes Visit?  Or ever?  Currently ever, any visit.
  - Do we expect to have any patients with Sickle cell disease, Chronic kidney disease, Rheumatic Heart Disease, Congestive Heart Failure?  We don't seem to capture this or have any.
